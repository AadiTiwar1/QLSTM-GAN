# QLSTM-GAN
Run qgan.ipynb to see the code that needs fixing with custom generator, and gan.ipynb for model code without custom generator. Repo that contains all files needed for QLSTM-GAN. There is an error running the main jupyter noteboook file that I need help fixing, if anyone can fix lmk. If there is an error with any of the .npy files or you need anything else, lmk.
